# ESPHome Configs

Configs used for managing my ESP devices

## Pool Controller

This is a weather station and pool monitor/controller.  Uses a BME280 for environmental monitoring,
 DS18B20 for pool temp, a SSR for controlling a peristaltic pump to feed chlorine to the pool and
 a contactless sensor to detect if my chlorine container is low.
